# SparkWeb

It's a small web application on Spark using HandleBars.js template.

The application has its own "database" and save cookies for each user. 

Also I worked a bit with responses processing. Created a template not-found.hbs 
and was throwing an exception with "Not Found" message and response status 404 if the user entered wrong path.
